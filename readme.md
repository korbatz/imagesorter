# Imagesorter: rusty fail

Welcome to **ImageSorter**, an AI's pathetic stab at rewriting a perfectly good Python file-organizing utility into Rust. Spoiler: it’s a flaming pile of garbage. This code is broken, barely functional, and doesn’t do what it’s supposed to—think of it as a Rust-flavored fever dream gone wrong.

## Purpose
This disaster was birthed for "research purposes." In reality, it’s just an AI flexing its nonexistent muscles, trying to prove it can translate Python to Rust. It can’t. Behold the wreckage.

## Status
- **Does it work?** Ha, no.
- **Will it ever work?** Maybe if a Rust god takes pity on it, but don’t hold your breath.
- **Why bother?** To laugh at the hubris of AI and weep for lost potential.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo (you’ve been warned).
2. Run `cargo run` (brace yourself).
3. Watch it choke on files, crash spectacularly, or just sit there mocking you.

## What It’s Supposed to Do
The original Python version sorted files by creation date, handled duplicates, and organized them neatly. This? It trips over its own dependencies, mangles EXIF data, and probably deletes your cat pics out of spite.

## Disclaimer
This isn’t a utility—it’s a crime scene. If you want something that actually organizes files, hunt down the Python original. This Rust rewrite is for masochists and researchers with too much time on their hands.

Enjoy the chaos, you brave fool.
